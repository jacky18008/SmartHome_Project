# Automated Smart Home Management System

## What is it?
It's a template of a Smart Home automated manage system, which is able to register, detect errors, and take action automatically.

## Social Relationship between Devices
According to [this paper](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7096253/), implementing a Social Relationship allows a manage system able to percept other devices by parsing a relation tree, making an automated management possible.

There are four importmant relationships in such paper:

1. IoT-Service relationship
2. IoT-IoT Relationship
3. IoT-Network relationship
4. IoT-Physical space relationship

and these relationships are all implemented in this project.
